The implementation of DGIMVCM involves two primary steps. First, ensure all necessary dependencies are installed by executing:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Subsequently, the training process can be initiated by running:

```
python train/train.py
```

Furthermore, experimental configurations can be customized by modifying the config.py file.
